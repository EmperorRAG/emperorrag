# Better Auth Admin Dashboard Implementation Plan

## 1. Backend Alignment

- Ensure `admin()` plugin is enabled inside `apps/better-auth-nest-js-microservice`.
- Expose secure NestJS routes that proxy Better Auth admin APIs
  (`list-users`, `create-user`, `update-user`, `ban-user`, `unban-user`,
  `set-role`, `has-permission`, `impersonate-user`, `list-user-sessions`,
  `revoke-user-session`, `remove-user`).
- Add integration tests covering successful delegation and auth failures
  for each route.

## 2. Shared Contracts

- Define DTOs in `packages/better-auth-utilities` for admin queries,
  mutations, user and session responses.
- Export Effect-based client helpers that call the Nest endpoints and
  share schema validation with both backend tests and the frontend.

## 3. Next.js Data Layer

- Add Route Handlers or server actions in `src/app/admin` that call the
  shared utilities while applying caching and revalidation strategies for
  `listUsers`.
- Introduce middleware that restricts admin routes to Better Auth
  sessions with admin privileges and surfaces redirect behavior for
  non-admin users.

## 4. UI Composition

- Create an `AdminDashboard` server component that fetches paginated user
  data and renders the shared `datagrid` component for display.
- Develop client components for toolbar controls (search, filter, sort,
  pagination) and mark them with `'use client'` to manage interactive
  state.

## 5. Action Workflows

- Implement modals or drawers that handle create, update, ban, unban,
  impersonation, remove, and session revocation workflows using the
  `adminClient()` plugin.
- Use optimistic UI patterns (React Query or Effect resources) to update
  the grid and surface toast feedback for success and failure.

## 6. Access Control UX

- Fetch permission data via `/admin/has-permission` and disable or hide
  action controls based on the returned capabilities.
- Show audit metadata within the grid (roles, ban reason, timestamps) and
  allow quick toggling of status indicators.

## 7. Testing and Hardening

- Add Vitest plus React Testing Library specs for client controls and
  server utilities.
- Expand Storybook or Playwright coverage to validate end-to-end admin
  flows.
- Include regression tests ensuring the datagrid renders primitive and
  JSX cells for Better Auth content.

## 8. Operational Readiness

- Document environment variables, admin seeding steps, and Nx commands in
  the frontend README.
- Provide runbooks for starting both the NestJS service and Next.js
  dashboard, highlighting shared config and troubleshooting steps.
