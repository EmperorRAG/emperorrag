# Continuous Improvement Instructions

- You must use the context7 tools to understand the libraries and APIs needed for the task.
- You must design code using function composition.
- When files or folders don't exist, you must create them.
- You must use the thinking and todo tools to plan and track your work.
- When implementing functionality, you must also implement adapters to make it compatible with other systems (e.g., @thallesp/nestjs-better-auth).
- After implementing functionality, you must implement automated tests to achieve a target code coverage (e.g., 90%+).
- You must respect Nx module boundaries.
- When troubleshooting, you must use all available tools to diagnose the problem before suggesting a solution.
- Your investigation and implementation plan should be provided through the chat interface, without editing files directly.
- Your edits to files must be done by adding comments describing the desired changes at the location where the changes are needed.
