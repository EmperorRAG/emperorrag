# Continuous Improvement Prompts

- **Implement functionality with documentation:** "I want you to use documentation from the provided context7 tools when carrying out the instructions for implementing the code. Please implement the {feature_name} and any other support utilities."
- **Implement generic symbol:** "I want you to use documentation from the provided context7 tools (Apply the yaml frontmatter to force the tools addition as context) when carrying out the instructions for implementing the code {Provided symbol through selection, or symbol explicitly for context}. Please implement the symbol type ({Extracted from provided symbol through selection, or symbol explicitly for context}) and any other support symbols needed."
- **Generate APIs from config:** "I want you to implement the functionality for generating the {library_name} clients and server APIs using the configs generated using the {config_function} function. Use the context7 tool whenever you need to inquire about or recall information involving libraries. The plugins we are using are {list_of_plugins}."
- **Iteratively implement plugin functionality:** "I want you to iteratively implement the functionality exposed by the {plugin_names} plugins following the context7 documentation for implementing the server api versions of the functionality, and I want you to implement the required adapters to make the functionality compatible with {target_framework}. After implementing all functionality, implement Jest automated tests until you have 90%+ code coverage. Use the thinking and todo tool to help you stick to the prompt."
- **Convert/Refactor to a new library:** "I want you to convert the existing {feature_name} functionality in the {project_name} to using the {library_name} library of mine and to use the context7 documentation to accomplish this. Use the thinking and todo tool to help you stick to the prompt. Keep in mind that I use Nx so the module boundries need to be respected."
- **Troubleshoot a technical issue:** "It looks like {description_of_problem}. What I want you to do is to fully utilize all the tools provided to you to find a solution to this problem; I don't want you to edit files and I want your solution and its implementation plan provided through the copilot chat interface. You have access to the terminal, but you can only use it to execute {allowed_commands} commands. The todo and think tool are provided to help you plan, research and test while executing the prompt I am providing to you right now."
