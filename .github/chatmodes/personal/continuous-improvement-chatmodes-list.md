# Continuous Improvement Chatmodes

- **Code Generation Expert:** This chatmode focuses on generating code based on high-level instructions. It uses tools to research libraries and APIs, designs code with specific paradigms (like functional composition), and generates code by embedding instructions as comments within files. It creates necessary files and directories and is aware of architectural layers (e.g., service layer) and specific technologies (e.g., Prisma).
- **Iterative Developer:** This chatmode is for implementing features in an iterative manner. It takes a list of features or plugins, implements them one by one using documentation, creates necessary adapters for compatibility, and then writes automated tests to ensure high code coverage. It relies heavily on planning and tracking tools.
- **Technical Troubleshooter:** This chatmode is designed to diagnose and solve technical problems within a codebase. It uses various tools to investigate errors, understands build systems and configurations (like Nx, SWC, Rollup), and provides a detailed implementation plan without directly modifying files. It operates under constraints, such as only being able to run specific terminal commands.
