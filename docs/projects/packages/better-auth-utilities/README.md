# Project Documentation: `better-auth-utilities`

## Overview

This directory contains the project management and high-level technical documentation specifically for the `@emperorrag/better-auth-utilities` package. It serves as the central hub for understanding the strategic vision, architectural decisions, and implementation plans related to this library.

## What is this Project

The `better-auth-utilities` project is a TypeScript library of reusable, functional utilities designed to work with the Better Auth ecosystem. Built with Effect-TS, it provides a collection of robust and type-safe helpers, adapters, and plugins that abstract away common authentication and authorization logic. As a package within the Nx monorepo, it is consumed by other applications and services to ensure consistent and simplified integration patterns.

## Document Structure

The documentation here is organized to support the full project lifecycle:

- **Product & Feature Planning**: Documents defining the scope, requirements, and goals for new utilities and features.
- **Architecture & Design**: Includes Architecture Design Records (ADRs) that capture key decisions about the library's structure, patterns, and public API.
- **Implementation & Specifications**: Detailed plans and technical specs for how features will be built.
- **Agile Artifacts**: Contains epics, features, and user stories that break down the work into manageable pieces.

## The `summaries` Directory

The `summaries/` folder within this directory is a critical component of our documentation strategy. It holds concise, non-technical descriptions of the library's components, goals, and use cases.

These summaries are the "source of truth" used to generate the more detailed project management documents found elsewhere in this folder, such as:

- Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)
- Implementation Plans
- User Stories

By maintaining these foundational summaries, we ensure that all project documentation is consistent and aligned with the core concepts of the `better-auth-utilities` package.
