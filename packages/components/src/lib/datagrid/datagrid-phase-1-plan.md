# Datagrid Phase 1 Implementation Plan

## Objectives

- Deliver a proof of concept table that derives columns and rows from JSON
  records passed via props.
- Keep data orchestration inside `Datagrid` so later features (pagination,
  filters) can plug into existing state.
- Follow React guidance on rendering lists with stable keys (React docs,
  Rendering Lists, react.dev).

## Scope

In scope:

- Accepting structured JSON array data and optional column ordering hints.
- Creating column headers from object keys when explicit columns are not
  supplied.
- Rendering body rows by mapping data objects to cells with stable keys.
- Styling the table with lightweight CSS modules already scaffolded.
- Providing simple empty, loading, and error states via props.

Out of scope:

- Pagination, sorting, filtering, or column resizing.
- Virtualization of large datasets.
- Persisting user interactions between renders.

## Inputs and Outputs

- Props
  - `data`: `Array<Record<string, unknown>>` (required).
  - `columns`: optional ordered definition for headers and accessors.
  - `isLoading`, `errorMessage`, `emptyMessage`: optional presentation flags.
- Output: semantic `<table>` structure with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and optional
  `<caption>`.

## Architecture Decisions

- Keep `Datagrid` as the orchestration layer; child components will render
  structural pieces (header, body, empty state) but receive prepared data from
  the parent.
- Derive column metadata by inspecting the first row when `columns` prop is
  undefined.
- Normalize rows into arrays of cell descriptors before rendering so future
  features (pagination) can reuse the transformation.
- Ensure each header and cell uses deterministic keys based on column id and
  row identifier to avoid reconciliation issues (React docs, Rendering Lists).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Prop Contract**
   - Define TypeScript interfaces for `DatagridProps`, `DatagridColumn`, and
     derived row shape.
   - Add JSDoc describing expectations for data normalization.

2. **Column Derivation**
   - Implement a pure helper that infers column ids, headers, and accessors from
     the first data row.
   - Merge inferred metadata with any explicit `columns` overrides.

3. **Row Projection**
   - Create a mapper that converts each record into an ordered array of cell
     values keyed by column id.
   - Support optional `rowId` accessors; fallback to index when no stable id is
     provided, but document the recommendation for stable keys.

4. **Rendering**
   - Build the `<table>` markup using `<thead>` and `<tbody>`.
   - Map columns to `<th>` elements and rows to `<tr>` elements, applying keys
     per React list rendering guidance.
   - Surface empty, loading, and error views within `<tbody>` when applicable.

5. **Styling**
   - Extend `datagrid.module.css` with baseline table styles (spacing, borders,
     typography) while keeping selectors scoped.

6. **Testing**
   - Update `datagrid.spec.tsx` to cover header rendering, row counts, and
     fallback states.
   - Add tests ensuring inferred columns work when no `columns` prop is passed.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests with React Testing Library for structural assertions.
- Snapshot tests optional; prefer explicit queries (`getByRole`) per React
  Testing Library best practices.
- TypeScript ensures prop contracts; enable strict typing in tests to catch
  missing data keys.

## Open Questions

- Do we need to support nested data paths (e.g., `user.name`) in Phase 1 or
  defer until richer column definitions are required?
- Should `Datagrid` accept async data sources (promises) or remain synchronous
  until pagination work begins?

  stability.
